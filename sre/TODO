* Servabit Reporting Engine TODO
** TODO Handle vertical and horizontal separators (toggle)
   - Vertical sep could be set by columns in the LM, along with alignment, just
     like TeX does.
   - Horizonotal sep may be toggle just on and off when intantiasing LongTable,
     but this solution eludes from the idea that all the formatting shuold be
     specified inside the LM.

** TODO Let the user specify a column's width inside the LM

** TODO Dinamic headers levels
   - Just test the length of LM lists

** TODO Set row (header) color(s)
   - Not sure if this could be achived in the template or must be responsability of LongTable

** TODO Decide wether to merge Table and LongTable
   - The only difference is the LaTeX "tag", the implementation is exactly the
     same, so maybe it would be better to simply add a parameter to the class
     intitializer.

** TODO Check the following warnings:
   - Overfull \hbox (14.88644pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 1058--1058
     []\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 675.28999999999996|

** TODO Define how to rappresent the table footer in the LM

** TODO Define a main procedure that fits any usecase
